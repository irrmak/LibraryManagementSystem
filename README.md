# Library Management System

## About the Project
This project is a simple console-based Library Management System written in Java.  
I built it as part of a university assignment to practice Java basics and object-oriented programming.

The program lets users manage library items like books, magazines, and DVDs through a menu-driven interface.

## What the Program Can Do
- Add new library materials
- List all materials
- Borrow and return items
- Reserve materials
- Display materials by category
- Handle basic user input

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming principles
- Java Collections
- Console input/output

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LibraryManagementSystem.git

2. Open the project in your IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, or VS Code)

3. Run Main.java

4. Use the menu shown in the console

## Why I Built This
The goal of this project was to improve my understanding of:
- classes and objects
- program structure
- user interaction
- basic software logic

## Possible Improvements
- Add a graphical interface
- Connect to a database
- Add user accounts
- Improve search functionality
