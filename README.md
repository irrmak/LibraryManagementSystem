# Library Management System

## About the Project
This project is a simple console-based Library Management System written in Java.  
I built it as part of a university assignment to practice Java basics and object-oriented programming.

The program lets users manage library items like books, magazines, and DVDs through a menu-driven interface.

## What the Program Can Do
- Add new library materials
- List all materials
- Borrow and return items
- Reserve materials
- Display materials by category
- Handle basic user input

## Why I Built This
The goal of this project was to improve my understanding of:
- classes and objects
- program structure
- user interaction
- basic software logic
